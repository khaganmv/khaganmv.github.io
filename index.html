    TODO:
        Unitards, jumpsuits, motorcycle suits, racing suits, tracksuits and dresses are basically outfits. Fix when implementing outfits. Make them a section of their own.
        Certain items have different male and female versions. Implement later.
        Bad Motherfucker Vest didn't work. Fix later.
        Might want to showcase both the front and back of inner and outer torso items. Consider later.
